# Awesome Developer Workflow
This README contains a curated list of awesome tips, tricks and tools for a better and more balanced workflow as a software developer. In addition, an example workflow is given that shows the different steps to solving any engineering task or software problem as a software developer.

## What Makes a Good Workflow
- Start small, focus on the problems you want to solve, and build integrations with other programs you use to build a productive workflow that suits your needs [2]

- Software engineering tasks are higher in their complexity due to their need to be integrated into a higher order and cross functional system [3]
- Do not rush into coding or architecting before having used a three buckets-checklist framework in order to improve efficiency and meet timeframe targets for any given task [3]
- When first being assigned a task as a software engineer, observe and reflect on what needs to be done as a whole [3]
- Start by writing down a three-bucket checklist, i.e. Goal, Deliveries, and Uncertainties [3]
  - Goal :arrow_right: What the task will achieve or enable (i.e. impact); usually a single goal, that should be broken down into different properties
  - Tip: Write down the goal and discuss and confirm it even if it seems obvious [3]
  - Tip: Start by understanding and reflecting about goals; then you can set the goals yourself [3]
  - Deliveries :arrow_right: 
- Example [3]:

```md
The Task:
(Our product has user account with profile picture)
Enable Drag & Drop images to update user's profile picture in the web platform. For now, users can only use the selection dialog to select and update their profile picture.
/** 
This example is more suited for Product/Fullstack SWE, but the checklist can be generalised for different schemes as well.
I will stick to this task while providing examples on the checklist. **/

The Goal:
Make updating user profile something faster, easier and intuitive by using Drag & Drop.
- faster: the process takes less time from end to end
- easier and intuitive: most users must understand the feature right away


```

- Problem-solving process:
  1. Identify the problem :arrow_right: 
  2. Gather information :arrow_right:
  3. Iterate potential solutions :arrow_right:
  4. Test your solution :arrow_right:

Problem-Solving Workflow
- Listen carefully ➡️ Pay close attention to any information given in the problem description
- Draw an example ➡️ Most examples are too small or special cases; debug your example
- State a Brute Force ➡️ State a naive algorithm and its runtime as soon as possible; optimize from there; do not code yet
- Optimize ➡️ Walk through the brute force with BUD optimization or
    - Look for any unused information
    - Solve it manually on an example; then reverse engineer your thought process
    - Solve it “incorrectly”; then think about why the algorithm fails
    - Make a time versus space tradeoff; Hash tables are especially useful
- Walk Through ➡️ Walk through your optimal approach in detail; make sure to understand each detail before you start
- Implement ➡️ Write beautiful code; modularize your code from the beginning; refactor to clean up anything that is not beautiful
- Test ➡️ Test in this order:
    - Conceptual test: Walk through your code like you would for a detailed code review
    - Unusual or non-standard code
    - Hot spots: E.g. arithmetic and null nodes
    - Small test cases: Much faster than a big test case; just as effective
    - Special cases and edge cases
